## Monitor deployments using the UI

When you navigate to the **Deployments** tab of the UI, you land on the **All Deployments** page, which shows all the apps for a specific tenant. If you don't see a deployment that you're expecting to see, refresh the list or verify the tenant the deployment belongs to. You can switch tenants in the top right menu by clicking on your username.

On the **All Deployments** page, you can select a specific app to go a page that shows a graphical representation the target environments that you defined in your deployment config file. If your deployment contains only one target environment, clicking the app takes you straight to target environment overview page.

### Deployment Graph page

The deployment graph page gives you a general idea of the state of the deployment and what environment CD-as-a-Service is currently deploying to.

More specifically, this view shows you how deployments are supposed to progress through different environments based on the constraints that you defined in the deployment config file. Clicking on a specific target environment takes you to the an overview page for that single target environment, where you can take additional action.

### Single environment

The **Environment Details** page for a single environment is where you monitor the progress of the deployment to that environment. If the strategy you specified involves user input, such as a manual approval, this is the page where you can approve or rollback the deployment.

## Monitor deployments using the CLI

If you want to monitor your deployment in your terminal, use the `--watch` flag to output deployment status.

```bash
armory deploy start  -f deployment.yaml --watch
```

Output is similar to:

```bash
[2023-05-24T13:43:35-05:00] Waiting for deployment to complete. Status UI: https://console.cloud.armory.io/deployments/pipeline/03fe43c6-ddc1-49d8-8116-b01db0ca0c5a?environmentId=82431eae-1244-4855-81bd-9a4bc165f90b

[2023-05-24T13:45:26-05:00] See the deployment status UI: https://console.cloud.armory.io/deployments/pipeline/03fe43c6-ddc1-49d8-8116-b01db0ca0c5a?environmentId=82431eae-1244-4855-81bd-9a4bc165f90b

```

If you forget to add the `--watch` flag, you can run the `armory deploy status --deploymentID <deployment-id>` command. Use the Deployment ID returned by the `armory deploy start` command. For example:

```bash
armory deploy start -f deployment.yaml
Deployment ID: 9bfb67e9-41c1-41e8-b01f-e7ad6ab9d90e
See the deployment status UI: https://console.cloud.armory.io/deployments/pipeline/9bfb67e9-41c1-41e8-b01f-e7ad6ab9d90e?environmentId=82431eae-1244-4855-81bd-9a4bc165f90b
```

then run:

```bash
armory deploy status --deploymentId 9bfb67e9-41c1-41e8-b01f-e7ad6ab9d90e
```

Output is similar to:

   ```bash
application: sample-application, started: 2023-01-06T20:07:36Z
status: RUNNING
See the deployment status UI: https://console.cloud.armory.io/deployments/pipeline/9bfb67e9-41c1-41e8-b01f-e7ad6ab9d90e? environmentId=82431eae-1244-4855-81bd-9a4bc165f90b
```

This `armory deploy status` command returns a point-in-time status and exits. It does not watch the deployment.
