In order to deploy AWS resources, CD-as-a-Service needs to create a Trust Relationship in your AWS account by adding an IAM role. CD-as-a-Service assumes this role to execute deployments on your behalf. The Armory CLI provides a function that creates an [AWS CloudFormation Stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) with an IAM Role, by default named **ArmoryRole**. You need to create a Stack in each AWS Account you want to deploy your AWS Lambda functions to.
