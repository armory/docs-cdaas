## Generate install script using a UI wizard

>You do not need to create **Client Credentials** for these options. The UI does that for you.

### Option 1

1. In the CD-as-a-Service Console, navigate to the **Welcome to Continuous Deployment-as-a-Service** [Configuration page](https://console.cloud.armory.io/configuration).

1. In the **Identify Your Cluster** window, enter an agent identifier for your Remote Network Agent (RNA) in the **Cluster Name** field. You install this RNA in the cluster where you want to deploy your app, so create a meaningful identifier.
