## How CD-as-a-Service monitors connected Remote Network Agents

The Agent Hub and the RNAs perform periodic healthchecks to ensure that the connection between the Agent Hub and your target deployment cluster is working. If the healthcheck fails, CD-as-a-Service removes the RNA from the list. When a subsequent check passes, CD-as-a-Service adds back the RNA and its cluster to the list with the **Connected At** column showing when the connection was re-established.
